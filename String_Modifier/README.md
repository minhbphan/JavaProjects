# String_Modifier
There are ... SO MANY String problems on LeetCode lol\
During my LC grind for recruiting, I did a bunch of these and decided it would be fun to make a program compiling my String knowledge. This essentially alters a String you input in various ways. In the Jan 23rd, 2020 version, we can:
<ul>
<li>Reverse the String</li>
<li>Turn it into lower/uppercase</li>
<li>Print all possible substrings</li>
<li>Check if itâ€™s a palindrome</li>
<li>Print longest palindromic substring</li>
<li>Revert String to previous state</li>
<li>Revert String to original state</li>
<li>And of course, quit</li>
</ul>
