# Sudoku_Solver
I bought my mom this book with 250 Sudoku puzzles and I swear we see God whenever we finish one.
Anyways, bactracking is so confusing I feel like I'm learning recursion for the first time :( Thought I'd give this Sudoku Solver a go to maybe help fire those hands-on-learning neurons??
